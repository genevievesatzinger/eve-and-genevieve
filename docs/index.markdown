This course presents techniques and tools in software design and development and applies them to the design and implementation of a large software system. The discussion includes the software life cycle; analysis, design, implementation, testing and debugging; maintenance and documentation; software reliability, portability, and expandability; and user interface.

As a central part of the course, student teams carry out projects for real clients, using concepts of agile software development. Each project includes all aspects of software development from a feasibility study to final delivery.
