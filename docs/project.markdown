Each student taking this course will participate in a semester-long software development project with an external client.

At the beginning of the course, you will present a potential software product that will be used to help you form teams with other like-minded students. During the semester, the project team will work together through the full development cycle, from an initial feasibility study to delivering a limited functioning product, and will make a series of presentations and reports of the work to the class.

# Deliverables

Since every software project is different, there is no set list of deliverables that every project must provide by the end of the semester. Part of your task is to decide what is needed for this specific project. Typical deliverables include working code, documentation, training materials, test suites, etc.

Every project should use a project management system for their documentation and code. This should be chosen in conjunction with the client, but a workspace in GitHub will be provided for you.

The projects are divided into four parts, each of which ends in a milestone. At each milestone, the team submits a written report.
After the second, third, and final milestones, the team makes a presentation to the client and the course team.

These are group projects, but you will also be rewarded individually for special contributions to the project, or failure to provide a fair share of the effort.

The three primary criteria for a successful project are: 
1. satisfying the stated customer's needs
2. usability of the product
3. maintainability over the life of the product
