## Coronavirus Policies

**VACCINES** For fall 2021, AU will require vaccines for all students who reside on campus or come to campus for any reason. This will enable us to expand activities and interactions that enrich the educational, research, and social experiences that are fundamental to AU. Students will be able to request exceptions for medical or religious reasons following existing protocols. We are also working to support international students who may require access to vaccines when they arrive in the United States.  Please see [Vaccine Requirement FAQs](https://www.american.edu/ocl/housing/room-selection.cfm#frequent).

**MASKS** The District of Columbia has reinstated mask requirements indoors for all persons over age two, regardless of vaccination status, effective Saturday, July 31. In accordance with the Mayor’s Order (Order 2021-097), anyone present in AU buildings or campus facilities must wear masks while indoors. The only exceptions are when eating or alone in an office or residence hall room. See [https://www.american.edu/ocl/masks-7302021.cfm](https://www.american.edu/ocl/masks-7302021.cfm) for more information.
- Students who do not attend class in an appropriate face covering will be asked to put one on.
- Students who do not agree to wear a mask will be asked to leave the room and will be marked absent for the day.

For more information about general policies regarding American University's response to COVID-19, please refer to the full memo at [https://www.american.edu/coronavirus/](https://www.american.edu/coronavirus/).

### Academic Integrity

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you are expected to do your assignments and work collaboratively with your assigned teammate(s), but not share code with other teams in the class. It is not appropriate to find existing code, modify it and submit it as your own work. Code submitted for projects may be compared to existing databases of example student work to verify authenticity. Exams and quizzes will be an independent effort. If in doubt, confer with your instructor.

All students are expected to adhere to the [American University Honor Code](https://www.american.edu/academics/integrity/code.cfm).

### Class Participation

It is expected that students will come to class, be prepared by doing the readings, and will pay attention and participate in discussions. Participation is scored by evaluation of in-class activities that you will submit at the end of most classes.

Any questions regarding general rules and regulations should first be directed to the American University [Catalog](https://www.american.edu/provost/registrar/university_catalog.cfm). If you still have questions, please seek out the TA or Instructor during the posted office hours.

### Use of Computers and Cell Phones in Class

[Educational research](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/22/0956797614524581.abstract) shows that taking notes by hand on paper will lead to better retention of material than taking notes by typing. Also, in the past classrooms have had issues with students not only not paying attention but also disrupting others during class - by playing games, by accidentally clicking on a video with the sound on, etc.

If you have a laptop, you should bring it to class. Do not use it for in-class assignments unless you are directly advised to do so by the instructor. Throughout the semester we will frequently pause lecture to work together to solve programming challenges in groups.

Please do not use your cell phone in class. If you have gotten this far in reading the syllabus, then [Snoop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOIvB2YtAhY) and I applaud you. Obviously, the language in the above section does not apply as much in remote learning as it does in the classroom. Still, it is good advice - many of the lectures are intended to be interactive, even online, and if you are casually ignoring the prof in a background tab you may miss something interesting. 

### Audio/Camera Policy

We strongly encourage you to turn on your camera during lectures, labs, and office hours. Faculty and students reported virtual classes are much better when we can see your faces because there is more visual communication, more engagement, sense of community and less multitasking. However, we understand sometimes you can’t turn on your camera due to connectivity issues or privacy concerns.  If you can’t connect with a camera, please upload a photo of yourself onto Zoom. If you have connectivity issues, please contact  techtaskforce@american.edu.


## Homework

Homework assignments will be graded on a rubric of criteria (specified on the assignment) such as accuracy of code input/output, completeness, runtime errors, comments, etc. For each criterion, you will receive either a check plus, check, or check minus. Most criterion will receive a check. A plus means "you impressed me." A minus means the assignment is incomplete, incorrect, or sloppy in some fashion with respect to that criterion. Pluses and minuses combine to give your grade for the assignment. For most assignments, you start out half-way between a B+ and A-. One plus makes it an A-; one minus makes it a B+. These are general guidelines to let you know what to expect. Grading on specific assignments may differ.

Project submissions that fail to compile will not be accepted under any circumstances.

All assignments will be submitted through the class Github system, which will be introduced in early lectures. Even though we encourage collaboration with your team, sharing code between teams is strictly forbidden - this is a form of plagiarism. If you directly copy and paste code from the Internet or the text, cite your source in your comments (but also ensure that you understand what the code is doing - not all code on the web is good!).

### Late Submission

Project deliverables are due at 8pm on the specified date unless stated otherwise. There is a grace period until midnight to account for technology issues during remote learning, but please treat 8pm as the deadline. Deliverables turned in after midnight will not be accepted. Projects are much larger than the homeworks assigned in the previous course, and students have multiple weeks to complete them. Waiting until the last minute is a recipe for disaster - if you are stuck early, come to office hours for the instructor or TA ASAP to get unstuck!

For the smaller individual skill-building assignments, these are due on the specified day at 8pm. A grace period of two days is provided to accommodate schedule challenges. 

## Attendance
Students must attend all lectures. If you need to miss class for any reason, lectures will be recorded and made available for review later. Not attending the discussion sessions and/or not reviewing the videos will negatively affect your ability to contribute to your team project and will hurt your scores on solo assignments and midterms.

## Exams
Exams cover the material from the lectures and reading. While not necessarily cumulative, each exam will require understanding many of the concepts covered in the preceding exams. Exams consist of multiple choice, short answer, and long answer questions. Each exam has equal weight and is typically curved based on class performance.

## Students with Disabilities
If you wish to receive accommodations for a disability, please notify me with a letter from the Academic Support and Access Center. As accommodations are not retroactive, timely notification at the beginning of the semester, if possible, is strongly recommended. To register with a disability or for questions about disability accommodations, contact the Academic Support and Access Center at 202-885-3360 or asac@american.edu, or drop by the ASAC in MGC 243.

## Academic Support
All students may take advantage of the Academic Support and Access Center (ASAC) for individual academic skills counseling, workshops, Tutoring, peer tutor referrals, and Supplemental Instruction. The ASAC is located in Mary Graydon Center 243.  Additional academic support resources available at AU include the Bender Library, the Writing Center (located in the Library), the Math Lab (located in Don Meyers Technology and Innovation Building), and the Center for Language Exploration, Acquisition, & Research (CLEAR) in Anderson Hall. A more complete list of campus-wide resources is available in the ASAC.

## Community-Service Learning Program (CSLP)

For those of you who are working with a non-profit or government agency, you might be eligible to enroll in additional credits through the CSLP program. 

Approved by the Undergraduate Senate in 1993, the Community-Service Learning Program (CSLP) is a type of community-based learning strategy that allows students to add a pass/fail credit to a class they are taking. 

As part of this CSLP add-on credit, students volunteer at a local organization whose mission connects with their coursework, thereby enriching the learning experience and strengthening the local community. 

For more information, visit the [CSLP Site](https://www.american.edu/ocl/volunteer/cslp.cfm).
